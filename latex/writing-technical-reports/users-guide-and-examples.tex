\subsection{User's Guide and/or Examples}

\label{sec:users-guide-and-examples}

This section should target the readers less interested in extending, or
integrating your application, but more interested in \emph{using} it to solve
the problem motivated in your introduction. Tell the reader how to run your
program, and showcase some examples.

Depending on the context of your report, an outright ``user's guide'' might not
be relevant, but it is always a good idea to showcase that your program works
for some sample instances of the problem.
